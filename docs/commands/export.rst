export
======

The ``export`` command converts saved assessment results from `GeoJSON <https://geojson.org/>`_ to :ref:`other GIS format <vector-formats>`. The command also includes options to select, organize, and rename data fields in the exported files. This page provides an overview of the command's steps, but see also the :doc:`Property Guide </guide/properties>` for detailed information on exporting data fields.


Select Properties
-----------------
*Related settings*: :confval:`properties`, :confval:`exclude_properties`, :confval:`include_properties`

The command begins by determining the data property fields that will be included in the exported files. The command begins with the fields listed by the :confval:`properties` setting, and then removes any properties specified by the :confval:`exclude_properties` settings. Then, the command adds in any properties specified by the :confval:`include_properties` setting. You can add properties to these settings using names, prefixes, and/or groups. You can learn more about these selection options here: :ref:`Selecting Properties <select-props>`.


.. _reorder:

Order Properties
----------------
*Related settings:* :confval:`order_properties`

Next, the routine reorders the exported properties to group related values together. Properties are grouped as follows, excluding any properties not being exported:

* ``Segment_ID``,
* Hazard, likelihood, and volume results -- grouped by I15 values,
* Rainfall accumulations and thresholds -- grouped first by duration, then by probability level,
* Model inputs (in :ref:`this order <input-props>`),
* Watershed variables (in :ref:`this order <watershed-props>`), and
* Filtering variables (in :ref:`this order <filter-props>`)

You can disable this reordering by setting :confval:`order_properties` to ``False``. In this case, properties will be exported in the order they are listed. If a property is listed multiple times, then its order will match its first occurrence in the property list. For example, the following configuration lists ``Segment_ID`` twice:

.. code:: python

    order_properties = False
    properties = ["Segment_ID", "results", "watershed"]

First, the field is listed by name, and then as a member of the :ref:`watershed group <watershed-props>`. In the exported files, ``Segment_ID`` will be the first property (rather than with the other watershed variables), because it is first listed by name in the property list.


Rename Properties
-----------------
*Related settings:* :confval:`rename`, :confval:`clean_names`

Next, the routine renames data fields as appropriate. The command first applies a default renaming scheme to result fields, which you can disable by setting :confval:`clean_names` to ``False``. The command then applies any user-specified names to the exported fields. You can learn more about renaming options in the :ref:`Renaming Guide <rename>`.


File Format
-----------
*Related settings:* :confval:`format`

The export command then exports the selected results to the indicated file format. The command supports many common GIS formats including Shapefiles, GeoJSON, Geopackage, and File Geodatabases. You can find a complete list of supported export formats in the :ref:`Vector Format Guide <vector-formats>`.


File Names
----------
*Related settings:* :confval:`prefix`, :confval:`suffix`

The exported files will be named:

* ``segments``, 
* ``basins``, and 
* ``outlets`` 

followed by the appropriate extension for the export format. You can also use the :confval:`prefix` and :confval:`suffix` settings to add text to the beginning and end of the file names. As these are file names, only ASCII letters, numbers, hyphens (``-``), and underscores (``_``) are permitted in the prefix and suffix. For example, you could use the following configuration:

.. code:: python

    prefix = "fire-id_"
    suffix = "_2024-01-01"

to export files named:

* ``fire-id_segments_2024-01-01``, 
* ``fire-id_outlets_2024-01-01``, and 
* ``fire-id_basins_2024-01-01``

The exported files will also include a ``configuration.txt`` config record, which can be used to exactly reproduce the exported files.
