Useful Datasets
===============

This page provides links to datasets that may prove useful for running wildcat. Note that you are not required to use these datasets for your own analyses. Instead, they are intended to provide a starting point for US-based hazard assessments and research.


.. _data-dem:

Digital Elevation Models
------------------------

`DEM Datasets <https://apps.nationalmap.gov/downloader/#/>`_

Use this link to download digital elevation model (DEM) data from the USGS National Map. The 10 meter dataset is most appropriate for wildcat. This is accessed as the "1/3 arcsecond" 3DEP Elevation Product.


.. _data-evt:

Existing Vegetation Type
------------------------

`LANDFIRE EVT Dataset <https://www.landfire.gov/>`_

Use this link to access the existing vegetation type (EVT) dataset released by `LANDFIRE <https://www.landfire.gov/>`_.


.. _data-kf:

KF-factors
----------

`STATSGO soils dataset <https://www.sciencebase.gov/catalog/item/631405c5d34e36012efa3187>`_

This link provides access to the STATSGO soils dataset, which includes a KF-factor archive useful for wildcat. The dataset is a collection of zipped Shapefiles, and the most relevant zip archives follow the naming pattern ``ussoils_XYshp.zip``. KF-factors are stored in the ``KFFACT`` field of the zipped Shapefiles.


.. _data-sbs:

Soil Burn Severity
------------------

`Burn Severity Datasets <https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/baer-imagery-support-data-download>`_

Use this link to download soil burn severity (SBS) datasets from `BAER <https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/>`_ data portal.


Precipitation Frequencies
-------------------------

`NOAA ATlas 14 <https://hdsc.nws.noaa.gov/pfds/>`_

Use this link to download precipitation frequency estimates from NOAA Atlas 14.



.. _data-fires:

Historical Fires
----------------

`MTBS Archive <https://mtbs.gov/direct-download>`_

This link provides access to the historical fire archive from MTBS. These datasets include:

.. list-table::
