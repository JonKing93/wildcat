Preprocessing Configuration
===========================

.. highlight:: python

These fields specify settings used to :doc:`run the preprocessor </commands/preprocess>`. Many of these fields are paths to input datasets. When a file path is a relative path, then it is interpreted relative to the **inputs** subfolder. If a file name does not include an extension, then wildcat will scan its parent folder for a file with a :doc:`supported extension </guide/file-formats>`.


----

Required Datasets
-----------------
These datasets are required to run the preprocessor. An error will be raised if they cannot be found.

Examples::

    # Absolute file path (may be outside the project folder)
    perimeter = r"/absolute/path/to/perimeter.shp"

    # Relative to the "inputs" subfolder
    perimeter = r"perimeter.shp"


.. _perimeter:

.. confval:: perimeter
    :type: ``str | Path``
    :default: ``r"perimeter"``

    The path to a fire perimeter mask. Usually a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file, but may also be a raster mask.
    
    The mask will be :ref:`buffered <buffer-perimeter>`, and the extent of the buffered perimeter will define the domain of the analysis. Pixels within the perimeter may be used to :ref:`delineate <delineate>` the initial network, and stream segments sufficiently within the perimeter are retained during :ref:`network filtering <filter>`.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical fire perimeters here: :ref:`Fire perimeter datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--perimeter <preprocess --perimeter>`

    *Python kwarg:* |perimeter kwarg|_

.. |perimeter kwarg| replace:: ``perimeter``

.. _perimeter kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _dem:

.. confval:: dem
    :type: ``str | Path``
    :default: ``r"dem"``

    The path to the digital elevation model (DEM) raster dataset. This dataset sets the CRS, resolution, and alignment of the preprocessed rasters. Also used to :ref:`characterize the watershed <characterize>`, including determining flow directions.

    The DEM must be georeferenced and we strongly recommend using a DEM with 10 meter resolution (Â±3 meters). This is because wildcat's hazard assessment models were calibrated using data from a 10 meter DEM. See also `Smith et al., 2019 <https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/7/475/2019/>`_ for a discussion of the effects of DEM resolution on topographic analysis.

    You can find links to 10-meter DEM datasets here: :ref:`DEM datasets <data-dem>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--dem <preprocess --dem>`

    *Python kwarg:* |dem kwarg|_

.. |dem kwarg| replace:: ``dem``

.. _dem kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


----

Recommended Datasets
--------------------
These datasets are not required to run the preprocessor, but they are either required or recommended for :doc:`running an assessment </commands/assess>`. To explicitly disable the preprocessor for one of these datasets, set its value to None.

Examples::

    # Absolute path (may be outside the project folder)
    dnbr = r"/absolute/path/to/dnbr.tif"

    # A file in the "inputs" subfolder
    dnbr = r"dnbr.tif"

    # Disable the preprocessor for a dataset
    dnbr = None


.. _dnbr:

.. confval:: dnbr
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"dnbr"``

    The path to the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) raster. Used to estimate debris-flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>` and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. Optionally used to :ref:`estimate burn severity <estimate-severity>`. Should be (raw dNBR * 1000) with values ranging from approximately -1000 to 1000.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical dNBR datasets here: :ref:`dNBR datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--dnbr <preprocess --dnbr>`

    *Python kwarg:* |dnbr kwarg|_

.. |dnbr kwarg| replace:: ``dnbr``

.. _dnbr kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _severity:

.. confval:: severity
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"severity"``

    The path to a `BARC4-like <https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/faqs>`_ soil burn severity dataset. Usually a raster, but may also be a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file. If a Polygon/MultiPolygon file, then you must provide the :confval:`severity_field` setting.
    
    The burn severity raster is used to :ref:`locate burned areas <severity-masks>`, which are used to :ref:`delineate <delineate>` the stream segment network. Also used to locate areas burned at moderate-or-high severity, which are used to estimate debris flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>`, :ref:`volumes <volumes>`, and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. If missing, this dataset will be :ref:`estimated from the dNBR <estimate-severity>` using the values from the :confval:`severity_thresholds` setting.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical burn severity datasets here: :ref:`severity datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--severity <preprocess --severity>`

    *Python kwarg:* |severity kwarg|_

.. |severity kwarg| replace:: ``severity``

.. _severity kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _kf:

.. confval:: kf
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"kf"``

    The path to a soil KF-factor dataset. Often a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file, but may also be a numeric raster. If a Polygon/MultiPolygon file, then you must also provide the :confval:`kf_field` setting.

    The KF-factors are used to estimate debris-flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>` and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. Values should be positive, and the preprocessor will :ref:`convert non-positive values to NoData <constrain-kf>` by default.

    You can find links to KF-factor datasets here: :ref:`KF-factor datasets <data-kf>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--kf <preprocess --kf>`

    *Python kwarg:* |kf kwarg|_

.. |kf kwarg| replace:: ``kf``

.. _kf kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _kf-factors:

.. admonition:: What's a KF-factor?
        
    Kf factors are defined as saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fine soil (< 2mm) fraction in inches/hour. Essentially, this is a soil erodibility factor that represents both (1) the susceptibility of soil to erosion, and (2) the rate of runoff, for soil material with <2mm equivalent diameter. See Chapter 3 of `USDA Agricultural Handbook 703`_ for additional details on its definition and calculation.

.. _USDA Agricultural Handbook 703: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo_Alvarez-Figueroa/post/soil_erosion/attachment/59d6460279197b80779a110f/AS:455706810818560@1485660378747/download/Renard_1997_+Predicting+soil+erosion+by+water_a+guide+to+conservation+planing+with+RUSLE.pdf


.. _evt:

.. confval:: evt
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"evt"``

    The path to an existing vegetation type (EVT) raster. This is typically a raster of classification code integers. Although not required for an assessment, the EVT is used to :ref:`build water, development, and exclusion masks <evt-masks>`, which can improve the design of the stream segment network.

    You can find links to EVT datasets here: :ref:`EVT datasets <data-evt>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--evt <preprocess --evt>`

    *Python kwarg:* |evt kwarg|_

.. |evt kwarg| replace:: ``evt``

.. _evt kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess

    What should happen when the DEM does not have 10 meter resolution (Â±3 meters). Options are:

    * ``"error"``: Raises an error and stops the preprocessor
    * ``"warn"``: Logs a warning to the console, but continues preprocessing
    * ``"none"``: Does nothing and continues preprocessing

.. confval:: constrain_dnbr
    :type: ``bool``
    :default: ``True``

    Whether the preprocessor should :ref:`constrain dNBR <constrain-dnbr>` data values to a valid range. Any dNBR values outside the valid range are converted to the nearest bound of the valid range.

The first value is the breakpoint between unburned and low severity. The second value is the breakpoint between low and moderate severity, and the third value is the breakpoint between moderate and high severity. A dNBR value that exactly equals a breakpoint will be classified at the lower severity level.
