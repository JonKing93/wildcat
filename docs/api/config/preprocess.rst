Preprocessing Configuration
===========================

.. highlight:: python

These fields specify settings used to :doc:`run the preprocessor </commands/preprocess>`. Many of these fields are paths to input datasets. When a file path is a relative path, then it is interpreted relative to the **inputs** subfolder. If a file name does not include an extension, then wildcat will scan its parent folder for a file with a :doc:`supported extension </guide/file-formats>`.


----

Required Datasets
-----------------
These datasets are required to run the preprocessor. An error will be raised if they cannot be found.

Examples::

    # Absolute file path (may be outside the project folder)
    perimeter = r"/absolute/path/to/perimeter.shp"

    # Relative to the "inputs" subfolder
    perimeter = r"perimeter.shp"


.. _perimeter:

.. confval:: perimeter
    :type: ``str | Path``
    :default: ``r"perimeter"``

    The path to a fire perimeter mask. Usually a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file, but may also be a raster mask.
    
    The mask will be :ref:`buffered <buffer-perimeter>`, and the extent of the buffered perimeter will define the domain of the analysis. Pixels within the perimeter may be used to :ref:`delineate <delineate>` the initial network, and stream segments sufficiently within the perimeter are retained during :ref:`network filtering <filter>`.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical fire perimeters here: :ref:`Fire perimeter datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--perimeter <preprocess --perimeter>`

    *Python kwarg:* |perimeter kwarg|_

.. |perimeter kwarg| replace:: ``perimeter``

.. _perimeter kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _dem:

.. confval:: dem
    :type: ``str | Path``
    :default: ``r"dem"``

    The path to the digital elevation model (DEM) raster dataset. This dataset sets the CRS, resolution, and alignment of the preprocessed rasters. Also used to :ref:`characterize the watershed <characterize>`, including determining flow directions.

    The DEM must be georeferenced and we strongly recommend using a DEM with 10 meter resolution (±3 meters). This is because wildcat's hazard assessment models were calibrated using data from a 10 meter DEM. See also `Smith et al., 2019 <https://esurf.copernicus.org/articles/7/475/2019/>`_ for a discussion of the effects of DEM resolution on topographic analysis.

    You can find links to 10-meter DEM datasets here: :ref:`DEM datasets <data-dem>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--dem <preprocess --dem>`

    *Python kwarg:* |dem kwarg|_

.. |dem kwarg| replace:: ``dem``

.. _dem kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


----

Recommended Datasets
--------------------
These datasets are not required to run the preprocessor, but they are either required or recommended for :doc:`running an assessment </commands/assess>`. To explicitly disable the preprocessor for one of these datasets, set its value to None.

Examples::

    # Absolute path (may be outside the project folder)
    dnbr = r"/absolute/path/to/dnbr.tif"

    # A file in the "inputs" subfolder
    dnbr = r"dnbr.tif"

    # Disable the preprocessor for a dataset
    dnbr = None


.. _dnbr:

.. confval:: dnbr
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"dnbr"``

    The path to the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR) raster. Used to estimate debris-flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>` and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. Optionally used to :ref:`estimate burn severity <estimate-severity>`. Should be (raw dNBR * 1000) with values ranging from approximately -1000 to 1000.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical dNBR datasets here: :ref:`dNBR datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--dnbr <preprocess --dnbr>`

    *Python kwarg:* |dnbr kwarg|_

.. |dnbr kwarg| replace:: ``dnbr``

.. _dnbr kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _severity:

.. confval:: severity
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"severity"``

    The path to a `BARC4-like <https://burnseverity.cr.usgs.gov/baer/faqs>`_ soil burn severity dataset. Usually a raster, but may also be a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file. If a Polygon/MultiPolygon file, then you must provide the :confval:`severity_field` setting.
    
    The burn severity raster is used to :ref:`locate burned areas <severity-masks>`, which are used to :ref:`delineate <delineate>` the stream segment network. Also used to locate areas burned at moderate-or-high severity, which are used to estimate debris flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>`, :ref:`volumes <volumes>`, and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. If missing, this dataset will be :ref:`estimated from the dNBR <estimate-severity>` using the values from the :confval:`severity_thresholds` setting.

    Most users will likely want to run wildcat for an active or recent fire, but you can also find links to historical burn severity datasets here: :ref:`severity datasets <data-fires>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--severity <preprocess --severity>`

    *Python kwarg:* |severity kwarg|_

.. |severity kwarg| replace:: ``severity``

.. _severity kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _kf:

.. confval:: kf
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"kf"``

    The path to a soil KF-factor dataset. Often a Polygon or MultiPolygon feature file, but may also be a numeric raster. If a Polygon/MultiPolygon file, then you must also provide the :confval:`kf_field` setting.

    The KF-factors are used to estimate debris-flow :ref:`likelihoods <likelihoods>` and :ref:`rainfall thresholds <thresholds>`. Values should be positive, and the preprocessor will :ref:`convert non-positive values to NoData <constrain-kf>` by default.

    You can find links to KF-factor datasets here: :ref:`KF-factor datasets <data-kf>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--kf <preprocess --kf>`

    *Python kwarg:* |kf kwarg|_

.. |kf kwarg| replace:: ``kf``

.. _kf kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess


.. _kf-factors:

.. admonition:: What's a KF-factor?
        
    Kf factors are defined as saturated hydraulic conductivity of the fine soil (< 2mm) fraction in inches/hour. Essentially, this is a soil erodibility factor that represents both (1) the susceptibility of soil to erosion, and (2) the rate of runoff, for soil material with <2mm equivalent diameter. See Chapter 3 of `USDA Agricultural Handbook 703`_ for additional details on its definition and calculation.

.. _USDA Agricultural Handbook 703: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Pablo_Alvarez-Figueroa/post/soil_erosion/attachment/59d6460279197b80779a110f/AS:455706810818560@1485660378747/download/Renard_1997_+Predicting+soil+erosion+by+water_a+guide+to+conservation+planing+with+RUSLE.pdf


.. _evt:

.. confval:: evt
    :type: ``str | Path | None``
    :default: ``r"evt"``

    The path to an existing vegetation type (EVT) raster. This is typically a raster of classification code integers. Although not required for an assessment, the EVT is used to :ref:`build water, development, and exclusion masks <evt-masks>`, which can improve the design of the stream segment network.

    You can find links to EVT datasets here: :ref:`EVT datasets <data-evt>`

    *CLI option:* :option:`--evt <preprocess --evt>`

    *Python kwarg:* |evt kwarg|_

.. |evt kwarg| replace:: ``evt``

.. _evt kwarg: ./../python.html#python-preprocess

    What should happen when the DEM does not have 10 meter resolution (±3 meters). Options are:

    * ``"error"``: Raises an error and stops the preprocessor

.. confval:: constrain_dnbr
    :type: ``bool``
    :default: ``True``

    Whether the preprocessor should :ref:`constrain dNBR <constrain-dnbr>` data values to a valid range. Any dNBR values outside the valid range are converted to the nearest bound of the valid range.
