Install Wildcat
===============

.. note:: 

    These instructions are for wildcat users. If you plan to develop wildcat, you should do a :ref:`developer installation <dev-install>` instead.

.. admonition:: Prerequisites

    Wildcat requires `Python 3.11+ <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_, and these instructions also require `git <https://git-scm.com/downloads>`_.


Quick Install
-------------

You can install the latest release using:

.. parsed-literal::

    pip install git+https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/wildcat@\ |release|\


Advanced Install
----------------

You can install a generic release using::

    pip install git+https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/wildcat@X.Y.Z

where ``X.Y.Z`` is the release tag. 

You can also install the most recent development from the main branch using::

    pip install git+https://code.usgs.gov/ghsc/lhp/wildcat@main

However, be warned that active development is not stable, so may change at any time without warning.
