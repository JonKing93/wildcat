# wildcat

A tool to assess and map post-wildfire debris-flow hazards.

## Summary

The wildcat package provides routines to assess and map post-wildfire debris-flow hazards. The package includes commands to:

* Preprocess input datasets,
* Design stream segment networks,
* Estimate debris-flow hazards and rainfall thresholds, and
* Export results to common GIS formats (such as Shapefiles and GeoJSON)

Wildcat can be run from the command line, or within a Python session. The package is intended for users who are interested in conducting and communicating hazard assessments. By default, wildcat implements assessments in the USGS style, but users can also configure the tool to run with modified settings.
