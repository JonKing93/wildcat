"""
Determines the paths to IO folders
----------
Most wildcat commands take various input files and then save various output files.
Relative file paths are searched for in a default inputs folder for the command.
All output files are saved into an outputs file for the command. This module
provides functionality to locate these folder paths, given the project folder.
----------
Functions:
    io_folders      - Locate the input and output folders for a command
    _input_folder   - Locates an input folder
    _output_folder  - Locates an output folder, creating if it does not exist
    _folder         - Resolves the path to a folder
