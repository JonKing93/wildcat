"""
Determine a file path based on user input
----------
Wildcat commands allow a variety of inputs for parameters that represent file paths.
Most simply, users can use an absolute or relative file path, and the command will
check that such a path exists. However, many datasets are optional, and so the
command will return None if a file cannot be located. Raises an error if a required
file cannot be located, or if a user explicitly provides a dataset that cannot
be found.
----------
Functions:
    file                - Determines the path to an input file
    _resolve_path       - Returns the absolute path to an existing file or None
    _scan_extensions    - Scans supported extensions when a file is missing
