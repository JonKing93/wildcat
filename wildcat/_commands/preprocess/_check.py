"""
Functions that raise warnings or errors if a condition is not met.
----------
Checks:
    resolution      - Checks that the DEM has approximately 10 meter resolution
    dnbr_scaling    - Checks that the dNBR has values outside the interval [-10, 10]
    missing_kf      - Checks if the KF-factor raster has missing values

Utilities:
    _isunexpected   - True if a resolution is outside the expected range
    _check          - Logs a warning or raises and error if a condition is not met
