"""
Functions that load saved assessment files:
----------
These functions load values that were saved in the assessment folder. The user
should not have altered the files in this folder.
----------
Main Functions:
    parameters  - Loads the hazard modeling parameters from the configuration.txt file
    results     - Load the CRS, schema, segments, basins, and outlets from the assessment

Utilities:
    _geojson    - Converts fiona records to GeoJSON-like dicts
    _segments   - Loads the saved segments, as well as the CRS and schema
    _features   - Optionally loads basins or outlets
